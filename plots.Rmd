```{r}
# Descriptive table
library(tidyverse)
dig.df
```
Instead of selecting the columns here, i did the cooking in the Assignment 4 then i just brought the output here.I will try to change the title of the columns later, to be more discernable. 
```{r}
#Plot 2 
#Hospitalization
dig.df %>% ggplot(aes(x=CVD, fill = factor(TRTMT))) + 
  labs(x="Treatment",
       title="Mortality between treatment groups") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#669933", "#FFCC66"),
    name = "Treatment group") +
  geom_bar(alpha=0.7, position="fill") +
  labs(x="Hospitalization for CVD",title = "Hospitalization in treatment and mortality groups")
```

```{r}
#Plot 3
#Death 

```

```{r}
#Plot 4
#Survival 
```

```{r}
#Plot5
#Scatter
```
